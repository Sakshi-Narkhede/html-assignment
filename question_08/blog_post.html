      <h2>Introduction:</h2>
      <p>
        I was facing a problem in everyday life, & couldn't really find any
        proper solution for it. That's when I thought, maybe I can turn this
        into a project. It might help others who are facing the same issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        While looking into how to get started, I found out that I'd need to
        create a website, and for that, learning HTML was important.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I began learning HTML to better organize my idea through a website.
      </p>

      <h2>My Learning So Far</h2>
      <p>I've learned the basics of HTML including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Headings (from <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>)
        </li>
        <li>Paragraphs</li>
        <li>Forms</li>
        <li>Tables</li>
        <li>Lists</li>
        <li>
          Semantic tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,
          <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and more
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Future Plans</h2>
      <p>
        I'm planning to learn JavaScript along with CSS. Starting JavaScript
        early is important since it's a bit tricky but super useful — not just
        for frontend work, but for backend development too.
      </p>
